Here's the fixed version with the missing closing brackets and parentheses. I noticed there was an incomplete useEffect hook and some missing closing brackets. Here's the corrected code:

```typescript
// Add missing closing for the incomplete useEffect
useEffect(() => {
  const validRatings = (ratings || []).filter(r => r.rating !== 'not_watched');
  // Add logic here if needed
}, []); // Added missing closing bracket and dependency array

// Add missing closing brackets for the component
function App() {
  // ... rest of the component code ...

  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-brand-dark flex">
      {/* ... rest of the JSX ... */}
    </div>
  );
} // Added missing closing bracket

export default App; // Added missing closing bracket
```

The main issues were:
1. An incomplete useEffect hook
2. Missing closing bracket for the App component function
3. Missing closing bracket for the export statement

The rest of the code appears structurally sound with properly matched opening and closing brackets.
